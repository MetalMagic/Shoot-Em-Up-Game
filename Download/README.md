# Shoot-Em-Up-Game
This is my first video game project to ever reach some sort of completion. I started this fall 2017 when I was just starting to learn c++. Ultimately though most of that code was rather poor so I restarted spring 2018. Some of the code here is still copied from the original version. There's a lot of things I learned with this project and a lot of things I'd do different but overall I'm happy to have it working and finished so I can move on to other things. 

I used the sfml library to help handle events, textures, audio, and the window. All of the source code is present except for config.h and the setup class. I kept those out because the game assets are hardcoded in there and I'd like to keep those private.
