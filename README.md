# Shoot-Em-Up-Game
A 2d space shmup game that takes about 2 minutes to clear.

This is written in C++ with the sfml library. All of the source code I wrote is present except for config.h and the setup class. I kept those out because game resources are hardcoded in there and I'd like to keep those private.

The credits.txt file gives credit for most of the textures and the music I used.

To download and play the game simply download the Game.zip file, extract it and run the Game.exe file.
