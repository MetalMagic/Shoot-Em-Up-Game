# Shoot-Em-Up-Game
A short 2d space shmup game.

This is my first video game project to ever reach some sort of completion. I started this fall 2017 when I was just starting to learn C++. I did restart the project to redesign it spring 2018 but some of the code here is still copied from the original version.

I used the sfml library to help handle events, textures, audio, and the window. All of the source code is present except for config.h and the setup class. I kept those out because the game assets are hardcoded in there and I'd like to keep those private.

The credits.txt file gives credit for most of the textures and the music I used.

To download and play the game simply download the Game.zip file, extract it and run the Game.exe file.
