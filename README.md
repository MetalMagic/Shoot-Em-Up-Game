# Shoot-Em-Up-Game
An old project, no longer maintained.

A 2d space shmup game featuring one level with a variety of enemies, bullet patterns, and a boss enemy.

The engine is written in C++ with the sfml library.

The credits.txt file gives credit for most of the textures and the music I used.

To download and play the game simply download the Game.zip file, extract it and run the Game.exe file.
