# Shoot-Em-Up-Game
A short 2d space shmup game.

This is my first video game project to ever reach some sort of completion. I started this project fall 2017 when I was just starting to learn C++. I did restart the project to redesign it spring 2018 but some of the code here is still copied from the original version.

This is written in C++ with the sfml library. All of the source code is present except for config.h and the setup class. I kept those out because game resources are hardcoded in there and I'd like to keep those private.

The credits.txt file gives credit for most of the textures and the music I used.

To download and play the game simply download the Game.zip file, extract it and run the Game.exe file.
